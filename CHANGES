  generated.

Version 0.20
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed an incorrect call into `want_bytes` that broke some
  uses of itsdangerous on Python 2.6.

Version 0.19
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Dropped support for 2.5 and added support for 3.3.

Version 0.18
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added support for JSON Web Signatures (JWS).

Version 0.17
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed a name error when overriding the digest method.

Version 0.16
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- made it possible to pass unicode values to `load_payload` to make it
  easier to debug certain things.

Version 0.15
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- made standalone `load_payload` more robust by raising one specific
  error if something goes wrong.
- refactored exceptions to catch more cases individually, added more
  attributes.
- fixed an issue that caused `load_payload` not work in some situations
  with timestamp based serializers
- added an `loads_unsafe` method.

Version 0.14
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- API refactoring to support different key derivations.
- Added attributes to exceptions so that you can inspect the data even
  if the signature check failed.

Version 0.13
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Small API change that enables customization of the digest module.

Version 0.12
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed a problem with the local timezone being used for the epoch
  calculation.  This might invalidate some of your signatures if you
  were not running in UTC timezone.  You can revert to the old behavior
  by monkey patching itsdangerous.EPOCH.

Version 0.11
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed an uncought value error.

Version 0.10
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Refactored interface that the underlying serializers can be swapped by
  passing in a module instead of having to override the payload loaders
  and dumpers.  This makes the interface more compatible with Django's
  recent changes.
